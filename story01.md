  One night while walking home, Johnny saw a young and lost girl. “What are you doing out this late?” Johnny had asked out of concern.no reply. The young girl stared at his eyes full with hate and anger. Johnny got suspicious of this girl and was a little terrified of her by now. Johnny however was still persistent in finding out what this girl was doing. “Are you okay?” The girl looked up, sadness in her eyes. "Nobody came to my funeral." She said. Johnny's eyes widened in fear. "You...you're joking, right?" Johnny stammered. "No one came to my funeral..."She repeated. Johnny took a step back.
